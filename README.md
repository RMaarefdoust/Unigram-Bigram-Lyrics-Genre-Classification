# Genre Classification Using N-gram Models

This Python script performs genre classification on textual data using both unigram and bigram models. The classification is based on the likelihood of a given text belonging to different music genres.

## Overview

The script uses a dataset containing lyrics from different genres such as Pop, Rock, Rap, Metal, Country, and Blues. It implements unigram, bigram, and combined models to calculate the probability of a text belonging to each genre.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You can install them using:

```bash
pip install nltk pandas scipy statsmodels scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/genre-classification.git
cd genre-classification
```

2. Run the script:

```bash
python genre_classification.py
```

3. View the results:

The script will output the predicted genre and probabilities for each model.

## Directory Structure

- `TM_CA1_Lyrics/`: Directory containing lyrics data for each genre.
- `test.tsv`: Test data for evaluating the models.

## Acknowledgment

Please note that the genre labels are generated by an AI system, which may introduce noise into the results. Use caution and consider potential limitations when interpreting the results.
